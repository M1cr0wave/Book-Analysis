# Chapter 1 Web Application (In)security

Before you continue, if you prefer reading this on Medium, here is the link to my article [Medium.com](https://medium.com/@nikhil-/chapter-1-web-application-in-security-02b8beceb7f9), and if you prefer reading it on Notion, say no less [Notion](https://nikhilkanade.notion.site/Chapter-1-Web-Application-In-security-2b9a8cd2a81e4a13991b293882e60b9f?pvs=4)

This chapter gave me a thrilling ride through the evolution of websites into dynamic web applications. Its actually crazy to think about how almost everything we interact on the web is actually a web application of one form or another. This chapter sheds light on the most common security challenges accompanying this transition.

## Overview

In the early days, almost everything on the internet was made up of static websites, something close to digital brochures. However now, every application relies on some customization to ensure the website is tailor made for that user. This brings us to the main problem. User Input!

## User Input: The Perpetual Problem

One key takeaway from this chapter is that most of the security problems in webapps occur due to user input, as a developer it is vital to understand how to process user input and identifying what parameters may tamper with the logic. A classic example of this is the wrong implementations of recaptch onto webapps. 

Yes, I hear you saying this is absurd, but hey, look at this:

Hopefully you believe me now :)

## SSL: A False Sense of Security

The book goes ahead to talk about how SSL became the holy grail of web security where websites started claiming they were "super secure" by simply having SSL. The book gives an introduction to some of the OWASP Top 10 and explaining how these were all problems and had no correlation with SSL whatsoever. "Attacks like Cross-Site Scripting, Information Leakage, and Cross-Site Request Forgery can still penetrate even the most SSL-protected sites" this is a constant reminder that security is a ongoing battle.

## Rapid Evolving Threat Profile

The notion of the "Rapid Evolving Threat Profile" fascinated me, offering profound insights into the security dynamics of DevOps. Imagine this: as a developer, you meticulously build a project, addressing every known vulnerability. Yet, a new 0-day vulnerability emerges the next day, demanding immediate attention. This constant battle underscores the ongoing challenge of security. It's not just about building a secure application; security transcends initial construction. Every website faces this perpetual struggle, requiring constant vigilance and adaptability. The "Rapid Evolving Threat Profile" epitomizes this challenge, emphasizing the need for continuous improvement and proactive defense measures. In this dynamic landscape, security is not a task but a relentless pursuit of excellence, driven by a shared responsibility to protect digital.

## Personal Insights and Learnings

- AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
- "A malicious attacker can leverage a benign but vulnerable web application to attack any user who visits it." The word benign basically means a web application that is intended to be safe and not harmful.

As we delve deeper into the world of web application security, let's remember that knowledge is our most powerful weapon. Really Excited to see what is to come further ðŸš€ðŸ”’
