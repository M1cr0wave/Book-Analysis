# My Reading Journal

Welcome to my reading journal! This repository serves as a record of all the books I have read, organized chapter-wise, along with my understanding of each chapter. Each book entry contains a breakdown of the chapters, key points, my thoughts, and any insights gained from reading.

## How to Navigate

- Each book has its own folder within the repository.
- Inside each book folder, you'll find separate markdown files for each chapter, named `chapter1.md`, `chapter2.md`, and so on.
- Additionally, you may find supplementary files such as notes, mind maps, or highlights, depending on the book.

## Contributing

I'm open to suggestions and discussions about the books I've read. If you have read any of the same books and want to share your insights or discuss further, feel free to open an issue or pull request. Let's learn from each other!


## Future Plans

To conver this into a webapp which is hosted on netlify and automating my analysis
